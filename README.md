## Summary

<!-- SUMMARY START -->
I am a Senior DevOps Engineer with 8+ years of experience architecting, migrating, and securing cloud-native systems. I specialize in AWS, GCP, and Alicloud, with a strong focus on Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, ArgoCD), containerization (Kubernetes, Docker), and CI/CD pipelines. My passion lies in driving efficiency and reliability through cloud automation and system optimization, as evidenced by my exploration of AI/ML homelabs and declarative OS management.
